You have to do all project work automatically as much as possible with taking my minimum involment. Add your more advanced sophisticated plan to the part of my work where something specifically not mentioned or mentioned very little. Ask me each time before implementation of any part of my work .You can suggest more possible good and advanced features for my 3D web-application and for business promotion. Always show your best quality with best work can give me. Minimum mandatory requirements has been given below:-
1. Core Application Information & Setup
Application Name: "Jai Guru Astro Remedy" (This will be the displayed name, customizable through the admin dashboard).
Purpose: To offer and manage personalized astrological consultations (live video call, chat, voice call, and in-person), provide structured astrology learning courses, and sell astrological remedy products globally. The application ensures my exclusive role as the service provider.
Domain & Hosting: The application will be deployed on my existing domain: www.jaiguruastroremedy.com and Vercel hosting (free tier). The chosen technology stack must be compatible with standard web hosting environments (e.g., LAMP stack for PHP/MySQL, or a host supporting Node.js/Python applications).
Specially Remember: you have to suggest all possible best plan and features for each part of project if you think that more better planning and advanced features are possible for my project and can implement those parts after taking my consent.
Target Audience: My personal astrology clients and students ( curious to learn astrology) globally.
Frontend: Modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular) for interactive and animated UI. Utilize a powerful CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or similar for responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.
Backend: A scalable server-side language/ framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, or PHP with Laravel) to handle business logic, data processing, and API endpoints. Choose based on hosting compatibility.
Database: A flexible and secure database ( MongoDB or other whatever you thing better for my project). After completion of web development firstly I want to see, check, test it on my localserver  (recommended by you ) compatible with the chosen backend and hosting. I have seen that many AI model faces problems during deployment of application via local server. So suggest best free localserver. You should try to work from the beginning such a way so that version mismatch and dependency file issues do not occur during development.
Communication & Notifications:
For real-time in-app video call and audio calls- Jitsi Meet's audio capabilities will be used for free app-to-app voice calls ( if you have other best suitable free plan you can suggest for ) between astrologer (me, My Name is “Arup Shastri”)
Video call: Integrate Jitsi Meet for secure and free video conferencing (using its public instances or a self-hosted one if feasible with the hosting).
In-app chat functionality will be implemented without relying on any paid third-party APIs or services (no external SDKs with free trials leading to pro plans). This will be built using core web technologies like WebSockets and a suitable backend framework to ensure it remains free of recurring external cost. Suggest your best free ( not paid ) chat option suitable for my application and my business.
Maximize automatic in-app messages and notifications directly to students'/clients' profiles/dashboards (e.g., welcome, booking confirmations, order updates, report availability, course progress).
All notifications (email/SMS reminders for consultations/orders) will be transactional and essential for service delivery, using a budget-friendly OTP service provider with global SMS capabilities that also supports basic transactional email sending( you can add all required free and paid API 
Payment Gateway: Use Razorpay & Cashfree for transaction within India. And Use Razorpay and Paypal for  international transaction.
External APIs (Preference for Free/Open Source/Budget-Friendly Tiers):
Time Zone Lookups: Integrate with a reliable, free timezone API or database (e.g., the IANA Time Zone Database often used with libraries like moment-timezone or date-fns-tz in JavaScript, or pytz in Python) for accurate display of local times for global bookings.
Geolocation: A free geolocation API for city/country lookups when entering client details (e.g., OpenCage Data Geocoding API with a free tier, or OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API) to assist in consultation scheduling and global physical delivery.
OTP Verification/Transactional SMS & Email: You have all ready done it . You should use twilio’s SMS and AMAZON’s free emails for implementing automation process in my project work. But remember that try to use sending automatic notifications within app ( such as, join live class, buy this new product,reminders for consultancy before 24 hours,1 hours and at the time of starting consultation )as much as possible by using code or other free method. SMS and Emails should be used when these are mandatory. Do not waste SMS and Emails using it where these are not mandatory.
LLM for Content Assistance: You can use the Gemini API (which has free tiers) or other to assist me in generating textual content like product descriptions, course outlines, or marketing messages. This is not for automated astrological interpretations.

4. Consultation Services (Online & Offline)

The integration should Allow me to initiate a Jitsi meeting directly from the client's booking.
Enable Custom Logo Overlay on My Live Video: My pre-uploaded logo (from the admin dashboard) must be displayed on my live video feed during the Jitsi call, with default 30% transparency(% should be changed manually from admin dashboard). This functionality should be implemented on the client-side when my video stream is active. Apply 6 varities of stunning  3D animated video background( for astrologer side ) suitable for my Astrology business( You can concentrate on 9 vedic planets of moving & rotating on the space/ night stars/galaxy view etc. that you think best for me).Give an option to upload background image during video call. Astrologer will be able to change these backgrounds during live video call ( consultation)
Enhance the colour & quality of video with professional look with giving suitable best looking animations and customize jitsimeet as much as possible with giving all possible necessary and possible features with my own branding ( with a default logo-I will provide that logo to you ,this logo should be manually changed by admin from dashboard ) and Name-“ Astrologer Arup Shastri ( Jai Guru )”. 
Video quality should be automatically adjusted according to hosting bandwith /space ( both for students/clents and astrologer,but remember that default resolution for astrologer side will be 1080p i.e FHD, if hosting does not support FHD then automatically it will fall down but will give maximum resolution within 1080p ) so that video does not stop during live session. For live video call, add an option for students and clients to manually change video quality with all possible resolutions (240p,360P, 480P,720P,1080P) to use their internet data as per their will. Use advanced high quality sound with sufficient loudness for video call. Set Maximum resolution (1080P i.e FHD) from both sides ( clients/ students and Astrologer ).
Online astrology class (Live video call) : When maximum no. of students ( default maximum limit 100) will be admitted for any astrology course, a new batch of same course ( already created by admin from dashboard )  will be automatically published and new students will join that 2nd batch. This way admin should create unlimited courses manually from dashboard and the courses should be published automatically on the basis of all possible criteria/condition i.e if maximum students (100) limit exceed for any running course, prescheduled (by admin) course ( 2nd batch) will be automatically published. Maximum limit of student should be changed manually by admin during each course creation.
Automatic in-app notification to the admitted students before 1 hour from the pre-scheduled class starting time and once more when astrologer will start class. A  “Join class” button (for joining live class) will be shown ( only student side ) inside each astrological course prescheduled. Give an option to astrologer to create manually ( from dashboard ) astrological courses ( both online and offline courses ) with all possible required details (with price).

Try to Provide a secure in-app meeting link for the client/online student to join without needing to download additional software.
In-Chat: Real-time, encrypted text chat during consultations. This will be implemented using core web technologies (e.g., WebSockets) to avoid any third-party API costs. The system should have the option to save chat history ( this chat will be performed within app ).

Integrated Timer: A visible, accurate timer for all video, chat, and phone calls. Default consultation time duration of 30 minutes will be automatically set for chat, video call, and phone call, but this default can be edited manually by me from the admin dashboard for each booking or as a global setting. The timer will allow me to manage consultation duration, and automatically calculate session charges. Give an alert for both side (student/client and astrologer ) 5 minutes before the consultation ends. Try to display timer count on both end ( for video call, phone call, chat during live consultation ). Try to keep an option- client can add anyone ( single or multi persons upto 4 ) during live consultation ( video call, phone call, and chat ). Live chat consultation should have features of sending text , image ,video, voice of good quality from both side ). 
Pre-consultation Setup: Ability for me to quickly pull up the client's profile, manually uploaded charts ( image/pdf file ) by clients  and hand typed notes before starting a call.

#when any client will book a session , he or she can choose any one of 3 consultation option-video call, voice call or chat.

Accessibility: Ensure basic accessibility standards are met for ease of use.
Multi-currency Display: Clearly show prices in the user's local currency based on their IP address or selection.
9. Legal & Compliance Features (Strong & Enforced for Global Service)
Mandatory Checkbox Consent at Signup/Purchase: During client/student signup and any purchase/booking process, clear, prominent checkboxes must be presented for:
"I agree to the Terms of Service" (linked text).
"I agree to the Privacy Policy" (linked text).
"I acknowledge and accept the Disclaimer" (linked text).
"I have read and understood the Product Return and Exchange Policy" (linked text).
Users cannot proceed with signup/purchase/booking without checking these boxes. Consent details (timestamp, IP address) must be logged for legal audit trails. 
Important: Keep an easy legal safe side for login students/clients whose age under 18.
In-App Legal Consents During Service: For specific services or data usage within the application (e.g., before initiating a video call, before a booking is finalized, or if new data types are requested), additional, context-specific checkboxes or explicit consent dialogues will appear and must be agreed upon by the client. These must also be logged as part of the audit trail.
Customizable Legal Pages: Prominent sections for my customizable Legal Disclaimer, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Product Return and Exchange Policy, and Refund Policy. These pages must be easily editable by me from the admin dashboard and publicly accessible via dedicated links on www.jaiguruastroremedy.com.
Data Minimization: Design the application to collect only the absolutely necessary personal and consultation-related data. Birth details are collected for my manual reference, not for automated calculation by the app.
Data Deletion Protocol: A clear and automated process for me to securely delete client/student data upon request or after a defined retention period, in full compliance with all relevant international data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, local Indian laws).
Audit Trails: Detailed audit logs for critical actions related to data collection, access, modification, and deletion to demonstrate compliance, as described in section 2.
Payment Security: Adhere to PCI DSS compliance standards if processing credit card data directly (though using a third-party gateway will offload much of this responsibility).
10. "Me-Only" Service Assurance (Critical Requirement)
Client/Student Accounts for Direct Interaction: Clients and students will have their own secure login accounts to access their profile, bookings, course materials, past orders, and communication with me.
No Multi-Astrologer Support: The system is designed and hard-coded for a single astrologer (me) and will explicitly not include any features for managing multiple astrologers, a marketplace, or peer-to-peer astrological services. My brand and services are the sole focus.
Direct Communication Only: All communication channels (chat, video, phone, email, SMS) facilitate direct interaction between me and my clients/students only. There are no public forums or client-to-client interaction features.

You have to plan how many menu  buttons should be created as per my scope of work and you have to create all required menus from the beginning on Home page. Because later you will implement one plan and then will change code of home page again and again for inserting only required menus- it will be disgusting and time wasting. You have to remember well that you have to work such a way so that i can finish my project as fast as possible. So always give me suggestions and correct codes such a way so that after checking one part , that part will not be required to change later during development since this is big project. So before implementing any part, read the project very well. You have to add the all required links of legal matters ( as you recommend best for me, like Terms of service, privacy policy, disclaimer, Return policy etc. ) as per my scope of work. These legal matters can be added during sign up process or and middle of the application ( where applicable) to keep me legally strongly secured. Remember that this is a global application.
create a suitable best your recommended plan to use and run my application safely with only free plan( since i do not want to buy paid plan of Mongodb ) of Mongodb and keep auto delete option of unnecessary data for users time to time.
